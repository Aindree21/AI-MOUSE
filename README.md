# AI-MOUSE
I have developed an AI virtual mouse system using python which can control the mouse functions by using hand gestures instead of using a physical mouse
Developed a virtual mouse application using Python and computer vision techniques. Utilized webcam hand tracking to simulate mouse actions by tracking
movements of the forefinger and middle finger. Implemented cursor control through forefinger movements and click actions based on the distance between the
forefinger and middle finger. Enhanced user interaction and accessibility by enabling mouse functionalities without physical contact with the system.
